====
BASH:
====

"$x" — ALWAYS PUT DOUBLE QUOTES AROUND VARIABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
	   All variables in bash are global !!!!!!!
"$*" — Combines all the arguments into single word, separating them with first character of IFS variable. If IFS is not set, space is used. If IFS is null, no separator is used!!!!!!!!! No args provided will result in one empty string being passed on!!! 
"$@" — Use this instead!!!!! Will retain arguments as-is, so no args provided will result in no args being passed on. This is in most cases what you want to use for passing on arguments.
	Google: "$@" is right almost everytime, and $* is wrong almost everytime.
"$#" — Number of arguments
"$1" — First argument
"$0" — Name of the script
$'\n' — String literal with escape sequences (there is a backslash before n)
	If you want IFS to be a new line (useful with for loop) you need to: IFS=$'\n' — The dollar forces substitution!!!!!
	Also if you want 'while read line; do...' to preserve leading spaces and tabs, you need to set IFS=""

=~ — Regex comparison operator: [[ "$HOST" =~ ^user.* ]]
let <expr> — Executes expression: let a="$b"+2

$(command) — Same as `command`
eval <variable> — Execute string as command
